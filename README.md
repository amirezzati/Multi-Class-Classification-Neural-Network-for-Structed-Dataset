# Multi-Class-Classification-for-Structed-Dataset
Multi Class Classification with Deep Neural Network for Structed Students Dataset using Keras

# Intro
**Project name: Deep Neural Network using Keras (Multi Class Classification students in 3 classes)**

I was written this as second project of my Deep Learning course in University of Guilan in April 2022.

# Description
The dataset has structed data from students that classified in 3 classes.   
This project has some Deep Neural Network to classify students. Neural Networks models implemented by Keras in tensorflow library.
